# kittycamera project

Mobile camera that used a raspberry pi 3 to control the angle of the camera ([pan-tilt HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pan-tilt-hat?variant=22408353287), documentation [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/pantilt-hat)) and based on [this](https://github.com/Mjrovai/Video-Streaming-with-Flask) Flask skeleton program to create a remotely controlloable camera... to follow my cat around when I wasn't home :D

The camera used to be available at [](www.kittycamera.live) when I had port forwarding set up on my home router in my last flat, with authentication to access the camera feed and control the pan-tilt hat.

Posted here archived as I will probably not use this project anymore.
